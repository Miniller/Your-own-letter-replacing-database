To use the program, you have to run it as administrator.
Q&A
Q: What's encryptionDatabase array?
A: I created this program as an encryption system, that encrypts every letter. You can change the variable name, but make sure to change it everywhere!
Q: How do I change what the letters will get replaced with?
A: This is an important thing. Basically, abc[0] will return a. encryptionDatabase[0] will return the replacement for a. So basically, abc[i] gets replaced with encryptionDatabase[i]. Therefore, for example if you want to change what d gets replaced with (also, everything is in lowercase, you can recode it to support uppercase.) (d is abc[3], but the 4th in the abc = {"a", "b", "c", "d"} array), you have to change encryptionDatabase[3], which, as again, 4th in the array. The index of it is always one less than it actually is from ,,outside''. Hope you understand this.
Q: What's the point of this?
A: Well, this can be used for so much things.. Replacing just a few letters, and making your friends guessing it, etc...  
Q: Can I claim the program as mine?
A: You can make your own version of the program then upload it. This is mentioned in the WTFPL license, as long as you change the name, you can.
This took me around 1-2 hours to make (I was tired, probably that's why).
